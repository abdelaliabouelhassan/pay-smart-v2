          Many cryptocurrency supporters believe that digital assets will
          quickly replace traditional money. Stablecoins, whose prices do not
          fluctuate as much as other cryptos, have a special chance for this.
          There are already solutions on the market that allow you to pay bills
          using cryptocurrencies. No wonder that banks began to be interested in
          blockchain technology. Wallex Bank is such a bank, and we had a chance
          to talk to their CEO, Simone Mazzuca.

            The first biggest challenge was to provide to businesses and
            individuals the proverb to the traditional financial system because,
            as you know, today banks are really aware of crypto and if you
            withdraw from any kind of a change your crypto in fiat – you get
            blocked. For this reason they had been the middle point that managed
            this to work.
